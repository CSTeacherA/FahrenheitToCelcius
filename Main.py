# write a program that will accept degrees in fahrenheit as an input from a user and convert it to celcius 
# use the functions int(input()) to get an input and convert it to a number

# the formula to convert fahrenheit to celcius is C = (f - 32 ) * (5/9)


# use round() to round to the nearest whole number


# use print() to display the converted degrees in celcius
